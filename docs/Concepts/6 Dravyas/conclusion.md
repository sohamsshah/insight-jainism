# Conclusion

- Out of all the 6 existents except the Soul, all the other 5 are non-living entities. The whole idea of understanding the 6 existents is to get true perception about one-self - Soul, the living.

- The most beautiful thing about the Universe is that there is existence of "Independence" to all the existents and nothing can directly influence another and change. Everything happens by one's own characteristic and virtue. This makes one realize that nothing in this Universe is responsible for one's happiness and peace; as the property of "happiness" is of one's own.
