- All the living organisms, from microorganisms, plants, macro species including animals and humans (also including the Heavenly Beings and Hellish beings existing in the different Realms of the Universe), all are Soul.

- The Soul is considered to be the non-material substance which has four main properties: Knowledge, Perception, Bliss, and Energy.

- Knowledge and Perception represent the "Consciousness" characteristic, while "Bliss" and "Energy" enable one to attain "Infinite Intelligence", "True happiness", and "Total Self-sufficiency"; in short, to become "God".

- Thus, every living entity in the Universe possesses the capability to become God.
