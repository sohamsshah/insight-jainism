# 0. Introduction

The true insight about the Six Existents (6 Dravyas) and the Universe has been one of the most important and essential concepts to be known in Jainism.

Because, without knowing what the Universe is, what the true identity of "our" true self is, and all the external materials we come in contact with, it is impossible to attain eternal peace, happiness, and salvation.

If we compare this concept with the modern science, it fits in the "Cosmology" and the "Metaphysics" branches of study. Moreover, all the facts and knowledge potrayed in the next slides has excerpts from multiple Scripture references dated approximate 2000 years back.
