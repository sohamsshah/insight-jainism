# 2. The Karmic Cycle

We saw what Karma is and what are its types. But how does it function? What is **The Karmic Cycle**? How to break free from it? We will talk about all these in this section!

## Introduction

The **real essense of Karmic Physics** is how these 3 types of Karma are interconnected closely with our lives and all the phenomena around us.

Important to note is that these Karmic Particles are **"matter"**, while we are **"Soul"**.

The Soul has the property of infinite bliss, supreme intelligence, infinite peace, absolute happiness etc. but because the soul is bonded by Karmas, they in a way obstruct our Soul's powers to be experienced at its fullest potential.

## The Karmic Cycle

Due to our (soul's) **"feelings"** of **attachment/aversion** on engaging with the material surroundings (No-karmas), the **Soul** attracts the physical **"Karmic Particles" (Dravya-karma)** to itself.

These **Karmic Particles** work in the following way:

- Once they **bind** to the soul, after a certain amount of time they come into action and **unbind** from the soul.

- When they **unbind** from the soul, they fruit us based on our past deeds (in simple words, the feelings that led these karmas to be bonded to the soul in the past) and thus we see different consequences around us based on the results of our past karmas.

Now, we know that when bonded Karmas of past come into action, we encounter different consequences (**No karma**) - good or bad. Involving into these **No karma**; the soul again undergoes "feelings" of attachment and aversion; and binds more new karmic particles. 

And in this way **the cycle keeps on repeating**!

If we think thoroughly, no phenomenon around us is without a reason. Nothing is random. Everything happens by **our own past karmas** which were **bind by our own feelings**, be it Good or Bad and the corresponding consequences are seen around us.

Another important thing to note here is the **independent functioning** of the Universe. These Karmic Particles aren't controlled by someone external!

They are just a part of the Universe as other physicalities. **"No one is the controller of the Universe, everything phenomenon happens by its own virtue of Happening."**

It clearly emphasizes that **"No one has control over our future. So in a way, we are the Sculptors of our own destiny."**

We now come to know that because of Karmas, we are suffering in the Universe (Sansaar). **Absolute Happiness can only be experienced if one is free from all the Karmas.**

**The path to become free from all the bonded Karmas to this Soul is the gist of all the teachings of Jainism. And when one is free from all the Karmas, one is called 'God'**

## Conclusion

Since every living organism is bonded by Karmas, but there is a way to end this Karmic Cycle; logically proves that every soul is capable of becoming God.

By our own efforts to **seek spirituality and experience the happiness inside ourselves (soul), we can get rid of "Bhaav Karmas", and hence breaking the Karmic Cycle.**

But wait, is this all about Karmas? **No.** This isn't even a tip of the iceberg!

There is detailed explanation about Karmic bonding, types of Karmas in nature, process of getting free from karmas etc. in Jainism Scriptures which makes Karma Theory unique and scientific to Jainism.
