# The 4 Karmic States

In the previous sections we saw what **Karma** is, how it works and what are its types in considerable detail. This section will cover details about the 4 Karmic States and their scientific aspect of Karmic Bonding in brief.

When Karmic Particles bind to our soul, it is called
**"Karma Bandh"**. And this Karmic Bonding can be broadly explained in 4 different States.

But, What are those 4 States?

1. **Prakiti**: Type of Karmic Particle (out of 8 different types).
2. **Pradesh**: The number of Karmic Particles bonded in that particular "Karma-bandh".
3. **Sthiti**: The time for which Karma will give its fruit (result).
4. **Anubhaag**: The intensity/strength of the results the Karmic Particle produces when it unbinds and fruits.

### 1. Prakriti Bandh

Once Infinite Karmas are binded to our soul, they are not all the same type.

Why? Because the results these Karmas produce are also different when they unbind, then definitely the types of Karmas binded must be different.

In previous post, we can recall the 8 types of Karmas like Gyaanavarniya, Darshnavaraniya etc.

In each samay (smallest unit of time), this soul binds all these different types of Karmas.

The different type of Karmic Particles bonded is called **Prakriti-bandh**.

### 2. Pradesh Bandh

Because of the vibrations happening in the soul some infinitely many karmic particles bond to our soul every "samay" (samay is the smallest unit of time).

The vibrations in Soul happen because of movements/changes in mind, speech and body. (this is called 'Yog' in Jainism and it is very detailed topic for the scope of this section).

The bonded particles are more and less in number based on the 'Yog' even though being infinite!

The number of "karmic particles" bonded to the soul is called **Pradesh-bandh**

### 3. Sthiti Bandh

Sthiti Bandh is the time for which the karmic-particle gives its result. How long does it give its result?

For example, if one binds karmic-particles of "sthiti" equal to "10 days", then the result due to the karma will be seen for 10 days i.e. until its **"Sthiti"** completes.

This state is decided based on the **Kashays** (feelings of Anger, Ego, Deceit, Greed etc.) done by the Soul.

The **Sthiti-bandh** in simple words is how much time it would take to Karmas to fruit. One did the deeds in past, how long one will get its result?

### 4. Anubhaag Bandh

**Anubhaag-bandh** state signifies with how much intensity the Karmic Particles will give their result.

If somone stole 10 million dollars VS. other person who stole 100 million dollars; in the court of law - how the judge will decide punishment?

The person who stole 10 billion dollars will bind Karmas with stronger anubhaag compared to the other. (this is just an example)

Meaning that they will face corresponding bad consequences based on their crimes by the Karmas they binded of corresponding **Anubhaag bandh**.
