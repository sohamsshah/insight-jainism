The single answer to all the **"whys"** of mankind can be found when one understands the laws of Karma. 

Generally, when anything bad happens to us; we tend to **blame** others for it. Many times, when something good happens; we wish to take all the **credit** for it.

But how does these things actually work? Is there someone else in the sky who is the giver of results? **If we are the one doing the act, then why someone else to be held responsible for giving the result?** 

Let us try to understand the answers to these questions from **Karma theory of Jainism**.

> **स्वयं किये जो कर्म शुभाशुभ, फल निश्चय ही वे देते।**<br />
**करे आप, फल देय अन्य तो स्वयं किये निष्फल होते॥**

This soul does **raag (attachment)** and **dwesh (aversion)** in the worldly objects.

Whatever good or bad - **bhaav karmas (feelings of raag-dwesh)** this soul does, the **result/outcome** of those bonded karmas will definitely come.

If you bind karmas by doing **bhaav (good or bad)** and the result is given by **someone else**; then the karmas bonded by you will become meaningless! The action of **good or bad bhaavs** will hold no value! **And hence, there will be devoid of any justice in the Universe!**

Karma Theory of Jainism teaches us that **"Everyone and everything in this universe is independent and in reality no one else except us are responsible for whatever happens to us!"**

> **अपने कर्म सिवाय जीव को, कोई न फल देता कुछ भी।**<br />
**पर देता है यह विचार तज स्थिर हो, छोड़ प्रमादी बुद्धि॥**

**Apart from the karmas bonded by us, no one else in the universe is capable to give us the result of those karmas!** 

Yes; this means that neither your family members, nor your spiritual guru. Not even the **GOD** is able to give, help, save or literally do anything for you. 

Because of the fact that **whatever happens to us is the result of our own bonded karmas; how can (or why should) someone else give me?**

And thus, leave this wrong belief or a false hope that God or someone else will help you. In fact, why someone who is free from all the attachments will help you? **God has shown the true path of helping oneself, the path of true freedom, the path of salvation and the path of true happiness. Is this not the truest form of help?**

Simple Laws of Karmas, ain't it?
