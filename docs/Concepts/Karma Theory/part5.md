Till now, we have got a basic introduction about Karmas, their types and how they function. Now, let us explore these **8 Karmas** more and understand them with simple analogies and examples.

### 1. Gyaanavaraniya Karma is like a Curtain...

Like a **curtain** hides whatever is behind it and doesn't let us 'know';

In similar way, **Gyaanavaran Karma** obstructs our ability to know, understand and grasp.

### 2. Darshanavaraniya Karma is like a Gatekeeper...

Like a **gatekeeper** doesn't let us see and perceive what is inside the house or a palace,

In similar way, the **Darshanavarniya Karma** obstructs our ability to do common perception about things.

### 3. Mohniya Karma is like a Drunkard...

Like a **drunkard** is unconscious about what is right and wrong, has lost control over his senses and roams around hopelessly,

In a similar way, due to **Mohniya karma**, this soul also gets unconscious and trapped into blind beliefs, anger, ego deceit, greed etc.

### 4. Antraya Karma is like a Treasurer..

Like a **treasurer/cashier** doesn't let the king do donations etc. by telling him to spend less;

In a similar way, **Antaraya Karma** is responsible for different obstacles that comes our way when we are trying to do some task (be it helping others or something for our benefit).

### 5. Vedniya Karma is like "Sword with honey applied on it"...

Like **if one tries to eat honey which is applied on the sword**, then one experiences sweet taste along with the pain of tongue getting cut by the sword.

In a similar way, **Vedniya Karma** is responsible for good/favourable and bad/unfavourable situations that happens to us.

### 6. Aayu Karma is like Handcuffs...

Like if **handcuffs** doesn't let one to be free, and keeps trapped inside a jail,

In a similar way, **Aayu-karma** traps this soul in Sansar (world), doesn't let one be free from all the miseries and makes one roam in 4 life forms - Human, Animal, Hell and Heaven.

### 7. Naam Karma is like a Painter/Artist...

Like an **artist** makes paintings of different colors, designs and styles;

In a similar way, **Naam Karma** is responsible for the different bodies, structure, shape, size, health, etc. characteristics of this soul. Everyone is having diff body shape and size. Naam Karma is the real reason behind it!

### 8. Gotra Karma is like a Potter...

Like a **potter** makes vessels of different shapes and sizes,

In a similar way, **Gotra Karma** is responsible for this soul being born in which type of family (higher-caste, lower caste, etc.)
High-low are actually defined based on the ethics and values followed in the family.
