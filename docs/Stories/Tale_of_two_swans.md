# A tale of two swans

"Father; see these beautiful baby swans! Aren't they just mesmerizing? Look, how they flap their wings and sway through the water...", said Yashodhar, stroking the soft feathers of little bird.

"Son, where did you get these baby birds?", scowled his father Pavanveg; the king of city 'Bhumitilak' situated in the "Dhaatkikhand" island.

"I brought them here from a flock nearby lake to play with them. I will take care of them; feed them the best food and give all the love as I might!", promised Yashodhar; with a sparkle in his eye.

"Alas, my dear son; you have committed a great sin. Did you not think about the restlessness, fear and sorrow of the ma and pa of these two baby swans must be going through? Imagine the immense emotion of despair and them into being deeply anguished for losing their little ones! Try to feel the shock and anxiousness of these little ones while being caged in this foreign bars! Can you not hear their weeps? No? Maybe its because your ears are blind out of noise of materialistic world outside."

"And, is it even justifiable to separate a child from its parent just for your own selfish desires?", lamented his father.

"Foolish humans have a tendency to justify their selfishness. And this act of yours; Prince Yashodhar - is an irredeemable mistake; that will fruit suffering to you in the future...", sighed the King; caressing the neck of the baby swan.

"But...if I had not brought them here and homed them in this cage; in the open unfenced nature - any wild animal would have feasted on them! Isn't it better to provide a safe life here; and probably even a prolonged lifespan?", intrigued Yashodhar.

"A short life lived in the free air is better than a long life spent in prison. Can anyone provide love, care and safety like of its parents? Never. Not even a cent close to that. Who are we to decide the destiny of this little one? Who are we to prison an innocent life? Beloved son; you with your pure heart; brought these lives here to play with and take care of them. But, was it not enough play for you to witness their free flight in the unending lake? Or eye their silver-lined white feathers sailing under the sun - and quench your thirst of finding beauty in the outside?" reflected his father.

"Ah, you are prisoned in the desire to find joy in nature. To find peace in the beauty of it. Has this soul not roamed enough in this infinite universe? You are enslaved by your senses, my dear. Sadly; you will never be able to satisfy yourself if you seek it in outside. The art of separating yourself, your true self - from the outside; is the gist of all spiritual knowledge you will ever seek. Because the art of believing, knowing and experiencing yourself (the soul) separate from this body, from your belongings and from the entire world - is the art of salvation ; and salvation (Moksh) is the state of being infinite bliss - the bliss that each and every soul in the universe seeks day and night. These little lives, they also possess the potential to become God, to attain salvation - just like you and me! Isn't it unjust to treat them with pain like these?", counselled the king.

This conversation with his father led to a deep feeling of regret. Yashodhar then freed the birds and let them fly their home where they belonged. But more than regret, there was a spark of curiosity ignited in the clean mind of his; which led to many questions about life, death, soul, universe and purpose.

After learning and contemplating upon about who he truly is, from where has come from, the reality of this world, karma theory, the universe and many more spiritual lessons from his father; Yashodhar was detached from the material world.
