One day, **Jeevandhar Swami**, akin to the most illustrious jewel among Kshatriya Kings and was the **24th Kamdev**, came to Jinalaya (Jain temple) to engage in prayers. His heart brimmed with contemplation on Vairagya (asceticism), a detachment from the materialistic world, as he inclined towards the path of eternal bliss.

He considered himself extremely fortunate to have the auspicious privilege of encountering a Jain Saint possessing [Chaaran-riddhi](./../Insights//64%20Riddhis/Kriya_Riddhi.md). King Jeevandhar felt profoundly grateful and blessed to have the opportunity to absorb the the spiritual wisdom imparted by the Saint.

Curiosity about his past birth and a desire to unravel the "whys" of his present life led Jeevandhar Swami to earnestly request the Saint to shed light on his previous life.

In response, the venerable Saint began narrating **'A Tale of Two Baby Swans'** unraveling Jeevandhar Swami's past life.

#### Jeevandhar Swami's past life as Prince Yashodhar

"Father, behold these beautiful baby swans! Are they not mesmerizing? See how gracefully they flap their wings and glide through the water," exclaimed **Yashodhar**, gently caressing the soft feathers of the adorable birds.

"Son, where did you acquire these baby birds?" questioned his father, **Pavanveg**, the reigning king of the city **Bhumitilak** situated in the **Dhaatkikhand** Dweep (island).

"I brought them here from a nearby lake's flock to play and interact with them. I assure you, Father, I will take utmost care of them—nourish them with the finest food and shower them with all the love I can muster," pledged **Yashodhar**, his eyes sparkling with sincerity.

"Alas, my dear son, you have committed a grave sin. Did you not consider the restlessness, fear, and sorrow that the parents of these two baby swans must be experiencing? Think about the profound despair and anguish they must be feeling, grieving the loss of their little ones! 

Try to empathize with the shock and anxiety of these young ones, now caged within unfamiliar bars! Can you not hear their cries? No? Perhaps it is because your ears are deafened by the noise of the materialistic world outside."

"And, is it even justifiable to separate a child from its parent for your own selfish desires?" lamented his father.

"***Foolish humans often have a tendency to rationalize their selfishness.*** This act of yours, Prince Yashodhar, is an irredeemable mistake that will yield suffering for you in the future," sighed the King, gently caressing the neck of the baby swan.

"But...if I had not brought them here and housed them in this cage, in the open, unfenced nature - any wild animal would have feasted on them! Isn't it better to offer a safe life here, and perhaps even a prolonged lifespan?" inquired Yashodhar.

"***A short life lived in the free air is better than a long life spent in prison.*** Can anyone provide love, care, and safety like their parents? Never. Not even a cent close to that. Who are we to decide the destiny of this little one? Who are we to imprison an innocent life? Beloved son, with your pure heart, brought these lives here to play with and take care of them. 

But, was it not enough play for you to witness their free flight in the unending lake? Or to behold their silver-lined white feathers sailing under the sun and quench your thirst for finding beauty in the outside?" reflected his father.

"***Ah, you are imprisoned in the desire to find joy in nature, to find peace in its beauty. Has this soul not roamed enough in this infinite universe? You are enslaved by your senses, my dear.*** Sadly, you will never be able to satisfy yourself if you seek it outside. The art of separating your true self from the external is the essence of all spiritual knowledge you will ever seek. Because the art of believing, knowing, and experiencing yourself (the soul) separate from this body, from your belongings, and from the entire world is the art of salvation. 

***Salvation (Moksh) is the state of infinite bliss—the bliss that each and every soul in the universe seeks day and night.*** These little lives also possess the potential to become God, to attain salvation, just like you and me! Isn't it unjust to treat them with pain like this?" counseled the king.

This conversation with his father triggered a profound sense of regret in Yashodhar. Consequently, he liberated the birds, allowing them to soar back to their natural home. Yet, beyond mere regret, a spark of curiosity was ignited in his pure mind, giving rise to numerous questions about life, death, the soul, the universe, and purpose.

Following an exploration and contemplation of his true identity, origin, the nature of reality, the theory of karma, the universe, and various spiritual lessons imparted by his father, Yashodhar became detached from the material world.

Deeply moved by his encounter with the baby swans and the spiritual teachings from his father, Yashodhar renounced the external world to delve into his inner self. Embracing the most profound benefactor of the soul, **Nirgranth Digamber Jain Diksha**, he embarked on a journey into the forest to engage in penance, meditation, and all acts aimed at purifying the soul from the stains of desires and aversions.

In a remarkable turn of events, not only Yashodhar but also his eight wives took **Aryika Diksha**, choosing to follow the path of salvation.

#### Elaboration of Jeevandhar Swami's past life

As the proverb goes:

> ***As you sow, so shall you reap.***

No deed is without consequence. Neither Ganga nor Yamuna can cleanse one's sins. Karma spares nothing. Not even the Tirthankars (and all Arihantas), who, through introspection into their own souls, become the destroyers of Karmas.

These [Karmas](./../Concepts/Karma%20Theory/part1.md) also did not spare the soul of Jeevandhar Swami, who, in a past life, committed the sin of confining the two baby swans.

Despite being the son of the prestigious and renowned King Satyandhar, Jeevandhar's birth unfolded in stark contrast to a life of luxury. His arrival occurred in a desolate graveyard, devoid of any witnesses. Tragically, his father had already perished in battle when he emerged from Queen Vijaya's womb. Compounded by an enemy invasion, his mother was forced to abandon him to fate and flee the scene.

Later in life, Jeevandhar Swami faced further challenges as he found himself ensnared and imprisoned within the stronghold of the enemy clan.

> ***Due to Jeevandhar Swami's past actions of separating the two baby swans as Yashodhar, he found himself enduring prolonged separation from his own parents in this current life. Furthermore, his act of confining the innocent birds resulted in his imprisonment by the enemy in this life.***

Isn't this insight fascinating?

#### Lessons to learn

Separating a child from its parents is a grave wrongdoing, and various current day evils are highlighted below:

- **Consuming dairy, egg, and poultry products** involves inhumane violence towards innocent beings. This cruelty extends beyond food to various everyday items like jewelry, skincare products, medicines, clothing (such as leather), causing extreme suffering to animals.
  
- **Domestic pets like dogs, cats, and birds** often face separation from their parents and natural habitat, resembling the situation faced by Yashodhar. Despite our intentions to care for them, the reality may be quite different.

- **Activities like visiting zoos or riding animals** for enjoyment fall under this category, contributing to the separation and suffering of innocent creatures.

Separating a child intentionally from its parents is a sorrowful topic that demands our attention and understanding.

- The distressing act of **Abortion** is prevalent in Western society and has unfortunately entered into Indian culture. This crime not only ends the life of the child but also kills the "mother" from a "woman".

- Another social evil is the killing of female infants with a desire of a male child. We should come together and take measures to **"Save girl child"**.

In essence, this brief excerpt from Jeevandhar Swami's story makes us realize the impact of our unconscious actions driven by materialistic pleasures, resulting in immense sorrow and pain for the soul.

***The route to salvation is to be free from aversions and attachments, to know the true nature of soul and the universe, and in turn breaking free from the cycle of birth and death.***

King Jeevandhar embraced this path, undertaking the revered Nirgranth Digamber Diksha in the Samavsaran of Tirthankar Mahavir. In doing so, he achieved salvation, enjoying the eternal bliss being experienced from the inside.
