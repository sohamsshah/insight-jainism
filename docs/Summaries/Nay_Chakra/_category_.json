      "description": "Nay chakra explains the concept of Nay (рдирдп) in Jainism. Nay is a term used to describe the different perspectives or viewpoints that can be taken on a particular issue or concept. In Jain philosophy, it is important to understand that there are multiple ways of looking at the same thing, and that each perspective has its own validity."
