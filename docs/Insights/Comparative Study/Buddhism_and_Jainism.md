This blog is a detailed comparative study between Buddhism and Jainism to highlight the similarities and differences.

:::note

The purpose of this blog is not to demean or offend any religion, caste, or creed. Instead, it aims to present a broader perspective on the subject through various logical arguments. 

While this write-up ultimately supports Jainism's theory, it presents balanced arguments and claims. Readers are encouraged to agree to disagree on such topics, as they are closely tied to our emotional and spiritual values.

### Before we begin

> #### If you view a lake from its shore, everything can to be at the same depth. Every point of the lake is felt to be similar. But only when you step in, you realize the massive differences of the depth.

> #### Some icebergs can seems tall; some short and some of similar heights. But measuring them from the surface of water is an act of a fool. Only when you measure from its depth; you can reach to a conclusion. Thus; never get taken away from the tip of the iceberg.

**Before we believe any philosophy / religion / spiritual ideology; we should always question these:**

- What is the purpose behind doing XYZ / believing XYZ / following XYZ?
- What it has to say about "Cause" and "Effect" about things. "Cause" is the WHY and "Effect" is the WHAT.
- Does it hold true partially or completely?
- Does it contradict with itself?
- Does it fail to "answer" any of your question? Or in other words - Can it answer all of your questions? (not necessary that you believe in that answer or not; but the answer should be coming from their own beliefs)
- Does it have "black box" answering? Like - People say God is above us. When we ask - Where above? They are clueless and then say - We cannot know it, only God knows it.
- What it has to offer you as an individual?
- Does it fear-monger you? Or it says - "What you want to hear"?
- Whom does it idolize? Whom does it pray? Why do they pray?
- Can you implement it practically? Because theory can take you only so far.
- Does it provide you any purpose or a direction? Or it just confuses you even more?
- Who is the preacher of the philosophy? Who are writers of the philosophy?

There can be a lot of questions like these. In fact, you can also come up with more. Because "genuine questioning" is a sign of curiosity.

### Origin

**Buddha** lived in northern India sometime between the mid-6th and the mid-4th centuries before the Common Era; founded **Buddhism**.

> According to the various traditions of Buddhism, buddhas have existed in the past and will exist in the future. Some Buddhists believe that there is only one buddha for each historical age, others that all beings will become buddhas because they possess the buddha nature (tathagatagarbha).

The above point somewhat resembles to Jainism's **24 Tirthankars**.

But here we have some questions:

- Who are these **Buddhas** and how they are born?
- **"All beings will become Buddha"** - Then what is a **"Buddha nature"**? If we have Buddha nature then what is stopping us?
- If **"Buddha"** is a reincarnation; then what were his previous lives?

There is scarce information available about the life of Buddha and his details. The details about the past Buddhas are hardly known to us. Putting us into a black box.

**Jain Dharma is a voice that depicts the nature of substance**. Because Universe is since infinity and will keep existing till infinity; Jainism is without any origin or end i.e. it is **Anaadi-anant Shashwat**. Jainism explains the Universe, tells "Who am I" and the path of attaining the self. So unlike **Buddhism**, Jainism has never originated. [Read more](./../When_did_Jainism_originate.md)

And it answers -

- In-depth details (names, life, symbols, age, previous lives etc. [Read more](../../Biographies/24%20Tirthankars/)) about the 24 Tirthankars of this, past and future Kaal.
- Jainism says from **"Dravya"** i.e. constant substance perspective, all souls are Pure. But from **Paryay** i.e. state, they are impure. A soul by recognizing the self, can become pure in **Paryay** too; and that is what it shows the path for! (Buddhism rejects the ideology of existence of **Dravya** constant substance and only believes in **Paryays**.)
- In depth detail (with mathematical formulas, scientific explanations, logical points) about each and every element of Universe.
- Buddhists do talk about different historical cycles; but lack any details. Jainism depicts [**Kaal Chakra**](./../Kaal_Chakra.md) in great depth.

### Buddhas and Bodhisattvas

> A person who has set out to discover the path to freedom from suffering and then to teach it to others is called a **Bodhisattva**. A person who has discovered that path, followed it to its end, and taught it to the world is called a **Buddha**. **Buddhas** are not reborn after they die but enter a state beyond suffering called **nirvana** (literally “passing away”). Because **buddhas** appear so rarely over the course of time and because only they reveal the path to liberation from suffering, the appearance of a buddha in the world is considered a momentous event.

In short - **Buddha** is one who has attained Nirvana; while **Bodhisattvas** are the one who are on the path of **Nirvana**.

This resembles quite a lot with Jainism's **Arihant** and **Siddha** **Parmeshthi** who have attained Nirvana (Arihant Parmeshthi has attained Omniscience, infinite happiness etc. and is guaranteed to become Siddh i.e. attained Nirvana after some time) and **Acharya**, **Upaadhyay** and **Sadhu** **Parmeshthis** who are on the path of Nirvana.

But then we question -

- Where is that Buddha?
- How is the Buddha feeling right now? What is he knowing / perceiving right now? Has he became "non-living"?
- What is his shape / structure after Nirvana?
- With whom does he interact? Is he alone or with other Buddhas?
- On what basis we decide who are Bodhisattvas? Is their outer conduct? Or way of preaching? Or what they are preaching? What is the deciding factor? If we don't know that then how can even follow them; or even identify them?
- What is exact path of salvation?

While in **Jainism**, it has the answers about -

- Who are these 5 Parmeshthis and their in-depth definitions
- Where is Siddh Parmeshthi located in the Universe
- Where is Arihant Parmeshthi and their time?
- Acharya Upaadhyay and Sadhu Parmeshthi can be identified by their conduct, preachings by us. And in absolute sense, based on their bonded Karmas particles a perfect identification of Souls in path of Salvation can be made.
- The path of salvation is in-depth in Jainism. Based on Karmas, Soul's growth in terms of happiness, belief etc. it is explained with the help of Gunasthans.

### Cause of Suffering

**Buddhism** believes in 5 aggregates of clinging called "Skandha" which is a cause of suffering -

1. form (or material image, impression) (rupa)
2. sensations (or feelings, received from form) (vedana)
3. perceptions (samjna)
4. mental activity or formations or influences of a previous life (sanskara)
5. discernment / consciousness (vijnana)

But here **Jainism** counters it with the fact that the **"Cause of suffering"** is not these mentioned aggregates of craving; but "Kashay" which are Anger, Ego, Deceit and Greed. One who is free from Raag, Dwesh and Moh; is free from suffering.

- How can **knowing a physical form** be a cause of suffering? By this logic, the plants (which possess least knowledge) will become the happiest.
- How can **sensory experiences** be a cause of suffering? Because if one is detached from it, then can one suffer?
- **Perceiving** the objects also cannot be a cause of suffering.
- **Mental formations** (which are possessed by sentient beings) also cannot be a cause of suffering because all beings without mind (like trees, insects, micro-organisms etc.) will be free from suffering!
- **Consciousness**, if be a cause of suffering then is Nirvana being "unconscious" like a non-living?

### Nirvana

**Buddhism** talks about Nirvana - to be free from sufferings.

They talk about the 4 Noble Truths -

1. Dukkha: The truth of suffering
2. Samudāya: The truth of the origin of suffering
3. Nirodha: The truth of the cessation of suffering
4. Magga: The truth of the path to the cessation of suffering

The Buddha believed that suffering is a personal choice, and that people suffer only as much and as long as they choose to. **He also believed that people can stop suffering by recognizing the Four Noble Truths.**

The **[Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path)** is a way to follow the Middle Way and find truth.

The eight parts of the **Eightfold Path** are:
**Right Vision, Right Values, Right Speech, Right Actions, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Meditation**.

Some counter questions which are not clearly answered around it -

- What is the order to follow these 8 parts?
- Is there any intensity of these? For eg. If I follow "Right Actions" partially, will it be considered?
- In **Right Actions** and **Right Values** "Non-violence" is central part. While Buddhism believes in "Middle way" and is fine with eating meat. (Even Buddha consumed meat). This contradicts with their own path!
- Moreover, how to decide what is "Right" and what is "Wrong"?
- What happens after **Nirvana**? What is the mental and physical state after Nirvana? **Buddhism** believes that even after Nirvana one can stay in body and can be completely non-attached while being wherever they are. This brings to a question that what if they get attached again? How do we differentiate them? What are qualifications of attaining Nirvana - because they don't specify any life form? Which means - can a plant or an insect do it? Though in Buddhism itself there are many conflicting views about Nirvana.
- What happens to the soul who has attained Nirvana and the body after death? Because Nirvana literally means to be free from all birth and death cycle!
- It says the Nirvana is when Soul is free from harmony and suffering; then what does Soul feel? If it doesn't feel harmony then what is the purpose of Nirvana?
- Soul becomes Characteristic-less at Nirvana. If a Substance loses it's characteristics, then can it even exist?

There are many such conflicts about the concept of Nirvana in Buddhism across multiple sects. Also, it is more of a theoretical explanation and lacks any scientific view over it.

On the contrary, Jainism's **Nirvana** is depicted in a much more deeper sense. Some points around it -

- Who attains Nirvana
- What are exact steps to be followed to attain Nirvana
- What is the state of body and soul after Nirvana
- What is Right and Wrong is clearly defined by the concepts of Gunasthan, Kashays, Moh etc. Right and Wrong are determined with the purpose. Whatever brings us closer to our purpose and our end goal is **Right**; while everything else is wrong.
- With scientific temper and mathematical calculations of 8 Karmas, Soul's happiness, Soul's journey to Siddhalaya etc. is worth exploring.
- Till how much time Soul will stay in Siddhalaya? Why won't ever the Soul come back to Sansaar after Moksh?

**Nirvana** in Jainism is to attain the **Swabhaav (pure and natural) State** of Soul. Since infinite time, the Soul has never realized himself i.e. never known "Who am I"; and thus wandering in the 3 Lokas in search of happiness.

When the Soul realizes the self and delves completely into self attains Nirvana. Till then, the 8 Karmas are bonded to it which are responsible to not let Soul's potential come out totally and hold the Soul suffer in the Sansaar (world). Once Soul achieves Nirvana state, he also gets free from the 8 Karmas.

### Unanswerable Questions in Buddhism

It is highly recommend to go through [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unanswerable_questions) and read the **Unanswerable** questions in Buddhism.

> They are sets of questions that should not be thought about, and which the Buddha refused to answer, since this distracts from practice, and hinders the attainment of liberation.

Some of the questions are -

1. The Buddha-range of the Buddhas [i.e., the range of powers a Buddha develops as a result of becoming a Buddha];
2. The Gyaan-range of one absorbed in Gyaan [i.e., the range of powers that one may obtain while absorbed in Gyaan];
3. The [precise working out of the] results of Karma;
4. Speculation about origin etc. of the cosmos is an imponderable that is not to be speculated about.

This leads to even more confusion and indeterminate view about the Universe and the self.

Buddhism says that the reason of **suffering** is desires etc. Then how is **Knowing** the answers of these Unanswerable questions can distract from the practice? **Knowledge**, if it is the nature of Soul - then how can we claim it to be a cause of suffering? How can "not-knowing" something hinder the attainment of liberation?

**Buddha**, after attaining Nirvana "refused" to answer. Is it not his attachment towards the people? Is "refusing" not an act of desire? This is again "self-contradicting".

While in **Jainism** all of the above questions are answered in depth. Nothing is "unanswered". Yes, if we don't have the scriptures which contain that knowledge, it can be unknown to us. But they are not "unanswered"! Because Jainism truly believes that "Knowledge" isn't the cause of suffering, desires are.

### Views about Karma

Buddhism believes in **Karmas** but doesn't depict how it works.

> The cycle of rebirth is determined by karma, literally "action". In the Buddhist tradition, karma refers to actions driven by intention, a deed done deliberately through body, speech or mind, which leads to future consequences.

**Buddhism says that Karmas lead to cycle of Birth and Death.
But it doesn't tell how to end these Karmas. That is an Unanswerable Question in Buddhism.**

This leads us to counter question -

- What are these Karmas? Is it a theory or do they also exist as a substance?
- Buddhism has internal conflicts with Karma bonding process. Some believe that Karmas is done by **Intention** (mind) while some believe it is by all 3 - Mind, Body and Speech. But no one knows the actual truth.
- What is Karma's role and state in Nirvana (that is to be free from Birth-death)?
- Does Karma affect Souls that are liberated?
- Karmas doesn't answer all phenomenon. It just says that you will get fruit of a deed you commit.

While in **Jainism**, Karma theory is not a theory; but science.

- Karma is a type of Karmic particle which bonds to Soul by Raag, dwesh and Moh; and a Soul can be free from it if he is free from Attachments and Aversions. It answers the questions about each and everything happening to Soul in the Universe.
- It can answer the cycle of birth and death; and also answers how to end it.
- There are complex mathematical formulas to explain the quantity (in infinite range) of Karmas getting bonded to Soul in how much time.
- There are different types of Karmas for different phenomena. There are different Karmic bonding states. In short, it is in great depth. **You can read more about Karma Theory in Jainism [here](./../../Concepts/Karma%20Theory/).**

### Cosmology

**Buddhism** tells that there are 6 worlds / realms; where where sentient beings are reincarnated based on their karma, which is linked to their actions in previous lives.

The 6 paths are:

1. the world of gods or celestial beings (deva)
2. the world of warlike demigods (asura)
3. the world of human beings (manushya)
4. the world of animals (tiryagyoni)
5. the world of hungry ghosts (preta)
6. the world of Hell (naraka)

**Buddhism** considers the first 3 realms as good while the latter 3 as bad. There is no such rule from which realm one can attain Nirvana. Though, they consider all these realms as a place of suffering. There is scarce detail about anything else in the Universe based on **Buddhist** scriptures.

We can present some counters here -

- How a Soul travels from one Realm to other?
- Where are these Realms located?
- What is the exact shape, size, area, geography, environmental conditions, number of beings living there, their life spans, body structure etc.
- What do these different world beings go through? And how do they attain Nirvana?
- How is the Universe?
- Where do Buddhas live?
- Good deeds take you to first 3 realms and Bad deeds take you to latter 3 realms. What are those things decided upon? Who governs all these?
- In response to the question since when beings wander within samsara (i.e. the Six Paths), **the Buddha answered that the starting point could not be identified nor understood**. This again puts us in a doubt if all these hold any reality or not.

In contrary, **Jainism**'s depiction of Universe is very minute and elaborated. All questions such as **Where is the Universe**, **How is the Universe**, **Since when is this Universe and till when it will last?**, **What are different Realms**, **Details about the beings living in each realm and different life-forms** and almost everything that you'd ask about the Universe are answered logically and scientifically.

Read about **How is this Universe** according to Jainism [here](../How_Is_This_Universe.md).

### Philosophy / Metaphysical viewpoint - "The Middle Way"

**Buddhism** considers everything as transient / changing. It doesn't account for a constant substance. It rejects the idea of **Absolutism** and believes that everything is **Temporary**.
According to some, **Buddhism** doesn't believe in any - "Absolutism" or "Nihilism" and guides to steer between them.

The below excerpt from the story of **Buddha** is notable -

> He resolved then to renounce his wealth and family and live the life of an ascetic. During the next six years, he practiced meditation with several teachers and then, with five companions, undertook a life of extreme self-mortification. **One day, while bathing in a river, he fainted from weakness and therefore concluded that mortification was not the path to liberation from suffering. Abandoning the life of extreme asceticism, the prince sat in meditation under a tree and received enlightenment, sometimes identified with understanding the Four Noble Truths**.

According to the story above, **Buddha** couldn't follow extreme asceticism and thus founded the **Middle way**.

**The Middle Way** is what steers clear of the extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification.

Problems with **The Middle Way**:

- How to identify the extremes? Without those extremes (that can change with time and geographical situations), how can we even devise a Middle way?
- In the **EightFold** Path, it is advised to not eat non-vegetarian food. But still because it is a middle way; it allows the followers to do whatever they want in the name of middle path - because that is what **Buddha** did!
- Jainism believes in both - **Absolutism** and **Annihilationism** but very specified and described. In other words, Jainism says that the substance is both **constant** and **changing**, and also explains how both of these exist in the same thing at the same time. One doesn't have to steer; but rather accept how the substance is. For eg. we believe that a human is changing (from child, to adult, to old man) but the person is also constant since the years. This is the beauty of **Anekantvaad** of Jainism! **Buddhism** is **Ekantvaad**.
- If nothing is constant then how does it make sense to renounce the world and follow the path to Nirvana? Because after each moment, the substance is destroyed and a new one is born; what is the point of making any effort?

Actually, the **Middle Way** of Buddhism introduced even more complexities and thus lacks clarity on the path of salvation. 

On the other hand, Jainism has very clear explanation about metaphysics of substances in the Universe and the path of Nirvana. A lot of logical conflicts also arise when we believe in **The Middle Way** of Buddhism; and are left with only one option to blindly believe in the teachings of Buddhism.

### The Preacher

**Buddha** is the preacher and founder of Buddhism. It is claimed that **Buddha** has attained Nirvana and then in his sermon he shows the path of Nirvana. And then the **Bodhisattvas** carry on and forward that knowledge from scriptures to the world.

Some problems with this - 

- If Buddha is free from all attachments and aversions; then why does he has a **desire** to share the knowledge?
- According to majority of **Buddhist** literatures, **Buddha** is not **Omniscient**. If he is not the **knower of everything** then how can he claim that the Universe is like this only? The path to Nirvana is this only? How can he make the path general for all beings if he is still unknown to the Universe?
- Buddhism is solely dependent on the Buddha and scriptures. Once both of them vanish, then there is no way that Buddhism can ever be preached again.
- Because Buddha is not omniscient, the depiction of the laws of Karma, the nature of Soul, the Universe, the God etc. are very abstract and weightless.

**Jainism** tells that there are **24 Tirthankars** in each time cycle who on attaining the state of **Arihant** (being free from Raag, Dwesh and Moh + Omniscient - The Knower of Everything but still in body) give **Updesh** (Dharm teachings about path of Salvation) but without any will / desire. 

The words reach to the listeners automatically and everything is answered by the **Tirthankar** without any desire / will (as they are free from attachments and aversions). 

The **Gandhars** in the Samavsaran compile the infinite knowledge of **Arihant** and passes down the **Acharyas, Upadhyays and Sadhus** who then pass down to other householders in the form of scriptures. 

Because this knowledge of the Universe has come to us from the **Omniscient Tirthankar Arihant Parmeshthi**, passed on by numerous **Acharyas** (who possess Satya-Mahavrat) and many Gyaani (spiritually-knowledgeable) souls this knowledge of Scriptures is - 

- so in-depth and minute for us to believe
- non self-contradictory
- purposeful showing the Path of Moksh / Nirvana / Happiness
- unchallengeable
- reliable
- has answers to everything

### Final words

From this blog, it must have been clear that there is a massive difference of depth on whatever is depicted between both the religions. While, it is not possible to put all details and debate on all topics of Jainism (and Buddhism) here; I have tried to cover major fundamentals of Buddhism here.
Though, it is always encouraged to research and compare on your own and decide what to follow.

Having said this - the span of this Human life is too short. We are very fortunate to have got the right path to happiness. Sure - do Research on other religions; if you might - but remember; **Jainism** is not a mere religion but it is the **Nature of the Substance**. And so, in your journey to happiness; you will have to come back to this path. 

So, in a way it is rather advisable to spend maximum time in exploring Jainism's concepts; learn and practice it to its core and **attain the infinite happiness that you, me and every being is in a pursuit for**.
