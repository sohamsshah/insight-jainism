### Counter arguments for Advait Brahman

-   **What exactly is 'Advait Brahman'?**  
    If everything around us is perceived as **independent** and **distinct**, how can we believe that all entities, which are fundamentally different (e.g., living vs. non-living), have different characteristics (e.g., water vs. fire), and undergo constant change (e.g., the atoms of wood turning into ashes, and ashes eventually turning into soil), are all ultimately one? If everything is one, then by what logic is this so?
    
-   **Advait Brahman teaches that:**
    
    -   You cannot know **Brahman** because of your delusion.
        
    -   **Brahman** cannot be known through **Yukti (logic)**.
        
    -   **Brahman** cannot be conveyed through **Vachan (words)**.
        
    -   It is both **one** and **not one**, **distinct** and **mixed** at the same time. Truly, **the glory of Brahman is boundless!**
        
-   **We ask:**
    
    -   For things that are clearly perceived by us, you claim they are mere **delusions**, yet when we apply logic to make assumptions, you say **Brahman** cannot be known through logic. On what basis should we then believe in it?
        
    -   If **Brahman** cannot be expressed by words, how can we possibly determine the truth without words?
        
    -   You state that **Brahman** is **one** and **not one**, **distinct** and **mixed** at the same time. But from what perspective (apeksha) is it one, and from what perspective is it not one? There is no clear specification of this perspective.
