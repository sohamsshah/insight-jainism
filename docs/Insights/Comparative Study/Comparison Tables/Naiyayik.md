### Comparison Chart

| Concept| Naiyayik  | Jainism | 
|--|--|--|
|  Tattvas (principles) | There are 16 Tattvas—such as _Pramāṇa_, _Prameya_, _Saṁśaya_, _Prayojana_, etc.—which are used for the discernment of knowledge or to demonstrate one's scholarship through debate, reasoning, or philosophical discourse. These are thought-based or logic-based principles, and do not represent the nature of substances.  | Jainism defines 7 Tattvas: _Jīva_ (soul), _Ajīva_ (non-living substances—Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, Ākāśa, Kāla), _Āsrava_ (influx of karmas), _Bandha_ (bondage of karmas), _Saṁvara_ (stoppage of karmas), _Nirjarā_ (shedding of karmas), and _Mokṣa_ (liberation from karmas). In this view, the soul’s attachments and aversions are called _Bhāva Karmas_, and the physical karmic matter particles are known as _Dravya Karmas_. Jainism’s Tattvas represent both the nature of substances and the principles of liberation.  | 
|  Creation | Naiyāyikas describe two types of soul (_Ātman_): 1. _Jīvatmā_ and 2. _Paramātmā_. _Paramātmā_ is described as the creator of everything in the universe. |  According to Jainism, there are three progressive states of the soul: 1. _Bahirātmā_ (the soul immersed in worldly attachments and aversions), 2. _Antarātmā_ (the soul turning inward and realizing its distinct nature from body and matter), and 3. _Paramātmā_ (the soul in its purest, liberated state, free from all karmic bondage). Jainism does not accept any creator or destroyer of the universe.

### Counter arguments for Naiyāyika

-   The Tattvas described in the Naiyāyika system do not include any principle that reflects the true nature of substances. According to their view, without understanding logic- and reasoning-based Tattvas, one cannot realize the true self. But by this reasoning, grammarians might argue that without studying grammar one cannot attain self-realization; or a cook may claim that without eating healthy food, one cannot realize the self in an unhealthy condition. In truth, these are external factors, while the only real path to self-realization—and thereby salvation—is through understanding the true nature of the self and reality.
    
-   Though they claim that realizing the true self (_Ātman_) is the ultimate goal, none of the 16 defined Tattvas directly relates to the self itself.
