### Comparison Chart

| Concept| Sankhya  | Jainism | 
|--|--|--|
|  Creation | Sankhya believes in 25 Tattvas (principles). There are three primary qualities: **Sattva** (joy or harmony), **Rajas** (restlessness or agitation), and **Tamas** (delusion or stupefaction). These three combine to manifest the state called **Prakriti** (1). Prakriti gives rise to **Buddhi** (called **Mahat**) (2), which in turn produces **Ahankara** (ego) (3). Ahankara then produces 16 components: 5 **Jñānendriyas** (senses of knowledge), 1 **Manas** (mind), 5 **Karmendriyas** (organs of action), and 5 **Tanmātras** (subtle elements – form, taste, smell, touch, sound). These 5 Tanmātras generate the five gross elements: **fire (20), water (21), earth (22), air (23), and space (24)**. Separate from all these is the **Purusha** (Soul) (25), who is the doer and experiencer. | Jainism holds that the Universe is without beginning or end. It consists of six eternal fundamental substances (**Dravyas**): **Jīva** (Soul), **Pudgala** (Matter), **Dharma** (medium of motion), **Adharma** (medium of rest), **Ākāśa** (space), and **Kāla** (time). Each entity is self-existent, with no creation or destruction. In comparison to Sankhya: Buddhi, Ahankara, and knowledge are seen as _attributes of Jīva_; Purusha corresponds to Jīva; the five senses and five elements are categorized as _Pudgala_; and the five Tanmātras are _attributes of Pudgala_. Prakriti can be seen as **Vishva** (the totality of the six Dravyas). The key difference is that Sankhya considers these elements as created, while Jainism sees them as inherently eternal and uncreated.   | 
|  Doership | **Prakriti** is the **doer (karta)** of all material evolution. **Purusha** is the **experiencer (bhokta)**, but not a doer.  | Every entity in the universe is independently the doer of itself. No entity is the doer of another in any way. 
|  Salvation | Salvation is achieved by realizing the distinction between **Purusha** (the 25th Tattva) and **Prakriti** (the other 24 Tattvas). Liberation is the separation of Purusha from Prakriti.  | Salvation is attained when the soul becomes free from all **Vibhāva** (non-self states or impurities) such as attachment and aversion, and reaches its purest form. This pure state is called **Godhood (Siddha-dasha)**. The path to liberation is through realizing, knowing, and immersing in the true nature of the Self.



### Counter arguments for Sankhya

-   Among Sankhya followers, there is no consensus on the existence of **Ishwar (a creator)**. Some reject Ishwar altogether, some identify **Purusha** as Ishwar, and others believe **Shiva or Narayana** to be God. There is no clarity on who is to be regarded as God.
    
-   Who is **Purusha**? Purusha is said to be **“Avaktavya”**—indescribable in words. If Purusha cannot be described, then how can one realize oneself as Purusha distinct from Prakriti—and thus attain salvation?
    
-   Sankhya holds that **Ahankara**, a formless (amurtika) entity, created the five senses and five elements (fire, water, etc.). How can something formless generate material objects?
    
-   A **substance (Dravya)** is said to possess characteristics. For example, fire possesses heat, orange color, and the ability to burn. But Sankhya claims that the five **Tanmātras** (Roop, Ras, Gandh, etc.), which are characteristics, created the five gross elements (fire, water, etc.). How can a **characteristic** be the **creator** of an **element**, when it is actually possessed by the element?
