### Comparison Chart

| Concept| Islam (Muslim)  | Jainism | 
|--|--|--|
|  Doership | _Khuda_ is the doer of everything in the Universe (similar to Advaita Vedanta, Ishwar-mat, etc.). | Every entity in the Universe is independently the doer of the self.
|  Avatars | _Paigambars_ are considered messengers of Khuda (similar to Avatars in Advaita Vedanta, Ishwar-mat, etc.). | Since Godhood (the purest state of the soul) is a state of being and not tied to a specific person, there is no concept of messengers or Avatars. Every soul has the equal potential to become a Siddha.
|  Good and Bad deeds | Khuda gives rewards and punishments (as in Advaita Vedanta, Ishwar-mat, etc.) | In Jainism, God (Bhagwan) neither punishes nor rewards. Karma is a separate entity (composed of matter particles) in the Universe that governs _punya_ (virtue) and _paap_ (sin). |
| Whom do they pray? | Prayers are offered to Khuda for both material and non-material needs (similar to Advaita Vedanta, Ishwar-mat, etc.). | Prayers are directed toward the five states of the soul, known as the Five Parameshtis, who are regarded as ideals to strive for.
| Salvation | Salvation is sought through praying to Khuda (just as in Advaita Vedanta, Ishwar-mat, etc., where people pray to Ishwar). | According to Jainism, salvation is not granted by any God and is not dependent on a divine being. By following the path shown by those who have attained liberation—namely, Arihants and Siddha Parameshtis—one can achieve the state of pure, eternal bliss (Moksha) and become a Siddha. The path to salvation constitutes of **Samyak Darshan** (right belief), **Samyak Gyaan** (right knowledge), and **Samyak Charitra** (right conduct).
