### Introduction

The foundation of any philosophy rests on its understanding and explanation of the causes and effects in the universe. **Many belief systems view God as the creator and operator of the universe.** But how valid and logical is this theory?

:::note Note

The purpose of this blog is not to demean or offend any religion, caste, or creed. Instead, it aims to present a broader perspective on the subject through various logical arguments. **This blog strives to explain the claims made in Jainism regarding non-creationism and the self-existence of the universe.**

While this write-up ultimately supports Jainism's theory, it presents balanced arguments and claims. Readers are encouraged to agree to disagree on such topics, as they are closely tied to our emotional and spiritual values.

:::

The goal of this debate is not only to argue that God is not a creator but also to describe the true nature of the universe and its substances, as outlined in Jainism.

Letâ€™s explore!

### 1. If God created the Universe...

**If they say** - There is a God (Ishwar) who created the universe, because how can anything exist without a creator?

**Then we ask** - If, as you say, "Without a creator, nothing can exist," then who created God?

**If they say** - God was created by someone else, then we'd ask - Who created that someone? This question leads to an infinite regress, known as **"Anavastha dosh"** in philosophy. In other words, it's a **paradox**.

### 2. Where was God?

**Then, we ask** - If the universe wasn't created before, then where was the creator God outside of this universe? **At which exact position was God when he created the entire universe?**

We all need some base to exist (land, water, nature, space, etc.). What was the base for God before the universe was created? Where was the universe placed after it was created? If you say the universe exists on some base, then we ask, **"What is that base?"**

1. **If they say** - There is some other base for it.

    **Then we'll ask** - What is the base of that other base on which the universe exists? This will again lead to a paradox.

2. **If they say** - It has no base, and in **Anaadi-nidhan** (one without start or end) substances and scenarios, no arguments or "whys" work.

    **Then we reply** - If the universe is without any base, without any start or end, then it doesn't need a creator. In Jainism, every substance in the universe (hence the whole universe) is considered **Anaadi-nidhan**; hence there is no paradox or conflict in this depiction. **Any opinion that supports God as a creator will encounter such paradoxes and faults.**

### 3. What was the Universe made from then?

**Then we further question** - The universe is **"Anekroop"** meaning it has many forms and components (e.g., different types of atoms, molecules, energies, souls, space, time). How could an **"Ekroop"** (single-formed) God create it? God is **"Amurtik"** (non-tangible, non-material) and without a body; then how could he create material substances like bodies? How can a non-material entity create material things? Without **Upaadan-kaaran** (the inherent ability to produce), nothing can be created or exist.

:::tip Upaadan and Nimitt Kaaran
For any event (karya) in the universe, there is an **Affluent cause** (Upaadan Kaaran) and **Instrumental causes** (Nimitt Kaaran).

A pot's **Upaadan Kaaran** is clay, while the potter's wheel, the potter, water, etc., are **Nimitt Kaaran**.

The pot is made from clay, and clay is the Upaadan Kaaran because it has the inherent ability to transform into the shape of a pot.

**Without the Upaadan Kaaran (clay), even an expert potter cannot make a pot!**

### 4. What were the raw materials made up of?

1. **If they say** - God made the raw materials first, then created the universe.

    **Then we ask** - If God needed raw materials to create the universe, who made the raw materials? To make these raw materials, something else is needed. This leads to another paradox!

2. **If they say** - Everything needed to create the universe was already available by its nature.

    **Then we say** - By your reasoning, you are forced to believe that the universe is self-existing by its nature. Just as you believe the creator of the universe is self-existing, you must also consider the entire universe as self-existing.

3. **If they say** - God is capable. Without any raw materials, just by his will, he created the entire universe.

    **Then we reply** - Apart from this claim of creationism **just by his will**, why would anyone believe in your theory? If creation is driven solely by will, one can imagine anything (like destroying the universe by will, making the universe a ball by will, turning all animals into flowers by will, and so on). **When you attribute creation to "just by will," all logical arguments and debates become meaningless.**

### 5. Is the creator Krutarth or not?

**We further ask** - Is God **"Krutarth"** (one who has nothing left to do, i.e., has attained and achieved everything) or **"Akrutarth"** (one who is still not satisfied and thus has wants and needs to fulfill)?

If he is **"Krutarth"**, then **how could he have a "will" to create the universe**?

If he is **"Akrutarth"**, then **he wouldn't be capable enough to create the universe**. Even a potter, after creating a pot, feels "Krutarth" (satisfied) If God created the infinite elements of this universe, and because he is **"Akrutarth"** (unsatisfied with the present), imagine how much suffering and anguish he must have faced while creating the universe.

### 6. If God is Amurtik, Nishkriya, Sarvavyaapi, and Nirvikaar...

**Then we ask** - How did this God create the universe?

1. If he is **Amurtik** (non-tangible, non-material), how did he create the universe, which consists of matter that is **Murtik** (material, tangible, corporeal)?

2. If he is **Nishkriya** (free from all kinds of activity or doership), how did the act of creation happen through him?

3. If he is **Sarvavyaapi** (omnipresent), how did he create the universe while being already present throughout it? By definition, being **Sarvavyaapi** means he is omnipresent in the universe from the beginning. Thus, when and how did he create the universe remains unanswered.

4. If he is **Nirvikaar** (without any transformation or change), then he cannot undergo any change or transformation to create anything. Therefore, the universe could not have been created by him if this attribute is true.

### 7. What was the expected outcome of this creation?

**We ask** - God created this universe. What was the expected outcome of this action? If God is Krutharth (completely satisfied) and has achieved all **four Purusharths** (Dharm, Arth, Kaam, and Moksh), then what purpose remains after creating this universe? 

> *Without a purpose, even a fool would not undertake any action!*

1. **If they say** - God had no purpose in creating this universe. It was made without any intention or reason. Then this entire creation would be rendered meaningless.

2. **If they say** - This is a "Krida" (play, activity for joy) of God.

    **Then we say** - "Krida" is also engaged in by innocent, immature, ignorant, and deluded children, or by those who were previously in grief and engage in activities to distract themselves. Is this the case with God as well?

### 8. Why God didn't make everything beautiful then?

If God made the universe, why did he not make everything bright, beautiful, wonderful, and happy? Why are there people who are poor, diseased, ugly, unintelligent, and of lower caste? Why did he create beings who are cruel, wicked, and ill-mannered?

In our experience, anyone who is intelligent and wise would naturally wish to execute their work perfectly and gracefully. 

> *No one desires to undermine their own creation.*

### 9. Why such an ugly creation?

Why did God, despite being intelligent, capable, and independent, create such an **ugly, fearful, sad, and clumsy creation?**

**If they say** - According to the karmas (actions) of the soul, the body and other materials are created for it.

### 10. Where is God's creator-ship and doer-ship then?

If karmas determine what a soul receives, then where does God's role as creator and doer come into play?

> *It's like a tailor making clothes based on the type of fabric provided by the customer; similarly, karmas dictate the body and other aspects given to the soul based on its past actions.*

In this scenario, where does God's role as creator and doer fit in?

### 11. There are many good and bad deeds done by the people in this world...

In this world, people perform different deeds, both good and bad. Are these actions performed with God's intention, or are they done against God's will?

1. **If they say** - It all happens by God's will.

    **Then we say** - Then why does God allow their creation to perform bad deeds that harm the world? Who would wish to make their own child a criminal?

2. **If they say** - It doesn't happen according to God's will. It happens according to their own will.

    **Then we say** - Then where does God's role as creator and doer come into play? All living beings are shown to be capable of performing their own actions (karmas) and don't require anyone else.

3. **If they say** - Actions happen according to past karmas (deeds), but are executed through instrumental causes.

    **Then we say** - Then why do you attribute the creation of this universe to God? (If God is merely an instrumental cause and all actions are based on individual karmas). 

> **Supporting a falsehood is indeed futile.**

### 12. If God loves all...

If God loves all; and created this Universe to love everyone - **then why did he not make this world a happy place; free from all sufferings?** Why did he add sadness, grief, loss, poverty etc.? In this way, where is the creator-ship of God?

**If they'll say** - Those who were devotees of God were made happy by him, and those who were wicked were given suffering and grief.

### 13. But why made the wicked...

In spite of being God, why did he create wicked people? Shouldn't he have made everyone his devotees instead? Why did he create his opponents and the cruel?

**If they say** - God didn't have the right knowledge at first, but when he saw wicked people, he started giving punishments to them.

**Then we say** - This logic suggests that God lacked wisdom initially. Does this mean the universe was created by an unwise, ignorant, and nescient being?

### 14. Was this Universe existing before?

If God made the universe, did he create something that already existed, or did he create from absolute nothingness (since there was "nothing" before the universe)?

1. If he created from something that already existed, then what was already existing - who created that? In this case, how can it be considered a creation?

2. If he created from absolute nothingness, this concept is difficult to comprehend and seems illogical. Before the universe existed, there was nothing; yet this "nothing" is also something where God was present. Claiming that God made everything from nothing implies that God should also be considered the creator of nothingness itself. This idea appears inherently flawed.

### 15. If God is truly free...

**We say** - Someone who has truly attained liberation (moksha) does not possess any "will" or desire. How then could such a liberated being have the inclination to create the universe? If one is completely free, there is no possibility of having any willfulness.

If God is not absolutely free (i.e., has not attained moksha), then he would be considered a **Sansari** (bound by attachments and aversions, subject to the cycle of birth and death). 

**In that case, how would God be any different from us?** Therefore, your assertion that the universe was created by God is clearly disproven.

### 16. Why to destroy this Universe then?

**We say** - First God created this universe, and then later destroyed it? This seems morally questionable and a grave sin.

**If they say** - Due to the rise of wicked beings (Daityas) in this world, God destroys the universe in a holocaust to eliminate them.

**Then we say** - Why did God create these wicked beings in the first place? If God did not foresee that these beings would turn out to be wicked at the time of creation, it implies a lack of foresight or knowledge on the part of God. 

Are you suggesting that God is ignorant and doesn't know the outcome of his own actions? Is God continuously creating new creations and destroying old ones to correct past mistakes through killing? Does he adopt different forms, use various weapons, and employ many strategies to eliminate the cruel?

### Conclusion

In this way, we can conclude that there are many imperfections such as ignorance, attachments, aversions, cruelty, cowardice, inability, lack of intelligence, anxiety, bondage, sorrow, and playfulness in the nature attributed to God as a creator or doer. 

Therefore, **God cannot be considered the creator or the doer of this universe.**

### Who is God (Siddh) then?

In Jainism, **God (Siddh)** is not a person but a **state of the soul**. The soul possesses the ability to know, believe, and feel, but it becomes trapped in this world due to its own attachments and aversions. 

Through purification, the soul can attain the state of Godliness. God represents the perfect soul that has fully realized its qualities at their highest potential, including infinite knowledge and infinite bliss. 

**Anyone who follows the path of salvation can achieve this state of Godliness.** There are infinite souls who have attained salvation, and countless more will continue to do so.


### How is the Universe?

The Universe is made up of [6 fundamental elements](/docs/Concepts/6%20Dravyas/part0.md). **All substances in the universe are self-existing; meaning no one has created them - and no one would destroy either.** All of them exist by the virtue of existence. 

Hence, **Universe is proven to be self-existing for infinity** i.e. without any start or end.
