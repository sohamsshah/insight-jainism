1. **Man Bal Riddhi**

It is the miraculous power by which the great Jain Saints can do the Chintvan (contemplate) of the complete Shrutgyaan in just Antarmuhurt time (under 48 minutes).

:::info

**Antarmuhurt** is a time-range from 6 Aavli + 1 Samay upto 1 Muhurt (48 minutes). Here, note that Antarmuhurt is in under 1 Muhurt time; and so we don't count the 48th minute.

Now, we just read that great Jain Saints possessing this Riddhi can

Contemplate (think deeply) the whole Shrutgyaan under 48 minutes. 

There are a total of **18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (i.e. 2^64 - 1) alphabets** in the complete Shrutgyaan; also known as **'Samast Shrutakshar Sankhya'**.

Which implies,

**Thinking 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 under 48 minutes;**

48 minutes is 2880 seconds.

And so it means,

**Thinking 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 under 2880 minutes;**

Dividing 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 / 2880; we get **6.4051195e+15**.

And this actually means that ->

**Contemplating / Thinking deeply a total of **6.4051195... x 10^15** alphabets in 1 second!!!**

Pause for a minute and think over this miraculous power possessed by the great Saints; the power that originates by the virtue of realizing ourselves i.e. Soul. If just Shrutgyaan is so great; then how can we ever be able to describe the infinite knowledge (Kevalgyaan) of the Arihant and Siddh Bhagwaan! All we can do is to bow down to them and follow their path to become like them. 

Antarmuhurt means any time value between 6 Aavli + 1 samay upto 48min. The value we derived was the minimum...Because we assumed that it takes 48min to contemplate the whole Shrutgyaan...While it is fairly possible that one can take 47min, 100 samay or so on! Isn't this beyond our imagination?

2. **Vachan Bal Riddhi**

It is the miraculous power by which the great Jain Saints can effortlessly clearly be able to know and speak (utter the words of the Shrut) the complete Shrutgyaan in just Antarmuhurt time (under 48 minutes).

This means that the great Jain Saint possessing this power can utter **6.4051195... x 10^15** alphabets per second! 

3. **Kaay Bal Riddhi**

It is the miraculous power by which the great Jain Saints can be without any fatigue or weakness even after performing Kaayotsarg for maas, chaturmaas etc. **By this Riddhi, they possess supreme physical strength enough to lift the whole 3 Lokas and swiftly displace it somewhere else with just their smallest little finger!**
