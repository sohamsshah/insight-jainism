The Miraculous Power by which one can practice the toughest and the greatest levels of Austerity is known as **Tap Riddhi**. 

There are a total 7 types of ***Tap Riddhis*** that are possessed by Jain Saints (Riddhi-dhaari muni) as below:
   
    1. Ugra Tap
    2. Dipt Tap
    3. Tapt Tap
    4. Maha Tap
    5. Ghor Tap
    6. Ghor parakram
    7. Aghorbrahmacharitva

1. **Ugra Tap Riddhi**

The saints possessing **Ugra Tap** are of 2 types:
1. Ugrogratap Riddhi Dharak
2. Avasthit Ugratap Riddhi Dharak

**1. Ugrogratap Riddhi Dharak**

The great Jain Saints possessing this Riddhi does Upvaas (fast) in below way:

    Day 1. Upvaas
    Day 2. Parna
    Day 3,4. Upvaas 
    Day 5. Parna
    Day 6,7,8. Upvaas
    Day 9. Parna
    Day 10,11,12,13. Upvaas
    Day 14. Parna
    Day 15,16,17,18,19. Upvaas
    Day 20. Parna

    They continue this Ugratap for their whole lifespan

In other words, they do 1 Upvaas, then next day Parna; then 2 days Upvaas; and then Parna; and increase one day of Parna after Upvaas... And continuously keep incrementing it for their whole lifespan! 

**2. Avasthit Ugratap Riddhi Dharak**

The great Jain Saints possessing this Riddhi does Upvaas in the below way

    Day 1: Upvaas
    Day 2: Parna
    Day 3: Upvaas
    Day 4: Parna
    Day 5: Upvaas

    One day, by some nimitt (external factor/reason); the saint does 2 Upvaas in a row. Then, from now onwards; the saint will continue his Tap as 2 Upvaas and 1 Parna. 

    Day 6: Upvaas
    Day 7: Parna
    Day 8,9. Upvaas
    Day 10. Parna
    Day 11,12: Upvaas
    
    Now, once again due to some nimitt; the saint does 3 Upvaas in a row. Then, from no onwards; he will continue his Tap as 3 Upvaas and 1 Parna. So,

    Day 13: Upvaas
    Day 14: Parna
    Day 15,16,17: Upvaas

    And so on. This number of Upvaas always keeps on increasing.

Unlike, Ugrogra Ugra Tap; in Avasthit Ugra Tap Riddhi the Tap (austerity) of the saint increases in a constant manner. This is being followed for their whole life-span! The great Jain Saints use these Riddhis to cut their time wasted due to Aahar (Bhojan) and delve more and more into the bliss of the soul by doing penance.

2. **Ghor Tap Riddhi**

It is the miraculous power of the soul by which the great Jain Saints can perform Tap (austerity) even if the body is affected from painful and deadly diseases.

3. **Ghor Parakram Tap Riddhi** 

It is the miraculous power of the soul; due to extreme austerity; the great Jain Saints possess unparalleled strength; enough to destroy the 3 worlds; to make severe falls of fire, smoke, rocks, meteorites etc. and vigour enough to dry the entire ocean!

Still, the saints possessing these strengths don't use for their selfish motives and wants. The reason is they are (almost) free from any aversions or delusions of the worldly materials! Why would they even have the thought of changing something else? **They are so dived into their ownself; that these worldly powers seem meaningless to them!**
