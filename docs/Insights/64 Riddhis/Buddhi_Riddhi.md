Out of 14, when great Jain Saint attains the complete knowledge till the 10th Purva, and because of this knowledge; there are many super-powers obtained and 1200 heavenly beings come to seek orders from them. But, because the Saints are victorious over the 5 senses, don't wish for those external praise or fame; their Charitra (right conduct) and 5 Mahavrats are not shackled by this. 

And thus, due to such great control over the senses; their knowledge of these 10 Purvas is called as "Dashpurvi Buddhi".

- 1200 Heavenly beings comes to him to seek orders under him
- If out of greed, the Muniraj gives order to those Devs, they lose their monkhood, Vrats and the ability for us to pray him. Because, in Jainism, we don't pray a person, but Veetrag state. These saints are known as 'Bhinn-dashpurvi'.
