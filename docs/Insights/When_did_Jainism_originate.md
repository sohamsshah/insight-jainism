Before answering this, let us know some ground principles of Jainism:

1. God is not the creator of the Universe. Universe is self-existing since infinite time and will never cease to exist till infinite time ahead. [Read more](How_Is_This_Universe.md)

2. God is not the controller or doer. Jainism preaches to pray the purest state of soul (and not a particular entity); which we aspire to become (i.e God). [Read more](./Is_God_Doer.md)

**"Dharma"** is defined as - "Characteristic of a substance (Vastu ka swabhav) is it's Dharma". 

> Jain Dharma depicts that true characteristic of the elements in the Universe and its core teaching is towards how to become God (achieving the pure state of soul).

So basically, the knowledge and practices that lead one to become God and explaining the true manifestation of the Universe is actually Jainism.

### So, then what is its origin?

As per our previous discussion - 

**Universe never started and will never end and Jainism is all about understanding true form of everything in the Universe;**

So, it is simple and intuitive to say that:

**"Jainism never started and will never end. The truth can never be altered, redefined, started or sugar-coated; but can only be accepted."**

Irrespective of number of people believing in it, or how hard is it to follow; the truth prevails. 

Let us look at some myths -
 
### Myth 1: Lord Mahavir is the founder of Jainism

This is probably the biggest myth people have about Jainism. Even CBSE textbooks taught wrong!

As we just read, Jainism was never started and will never end; no one can be the "founder" of it. 

Moreover, Lord Mahavir is the **24th Tirthankar** of this era; meaning that 23 other Tirthankars already preached Jainism before!

**Lord Mahavir preached (not founded) the truth, path to salvation; and all the knowledge we have today is indebted by those preachings.**
 
### Myth 2: Jainism is a part of Hinduism or Buddhism

Many people think that Jainism is a sub-section of Hinduism or Buddhism. Some people also make baseless claims like - Mahavir was a disciple of Buddha.

But if we look at Jainism's core principles like** "Everyone can become God"**, **"God as not the doer"**, **"Universe was never created"**, etc. it is very clear that it is not a part of or has originated from Hinduism.

It has a different philosophy than Hinduism or Buddhism.
