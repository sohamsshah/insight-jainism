# Conclusion

**"Triloksar"** is in itself a fascinating, core and an important Jain Scripture which teaches us about the real manifestation of the Universe, how it functions and everything around this topic.

In fact, in today's world; we are slowly heading to believe in scientific viewpoints more than anything, the scriptures like Triloksar are a blessing for us to realize how great our Jainism is - that 1000 years before where modern science was not even found; our Digamber Jain Saints wrote these things.

**Indeed, Karnanuyog Scriptures are a reflection of Kevalgyaan (Infinite Knowledge) of God!**

Also,
"Triloksar" - Trilok + Saar = Summary of 3 Lokas (worlds).

Just imagine, if the Summary is such detailed, how minute the real description would be? It really makes us respect and proud of what we have got.

**How great is Jainism? Where each and everything has got a logical explanation; where everything is backed by science and mathematics?**

These Scriptures are written by such great saints for us curious minds only; so that we understand the truth and get on the path of Moksh.

As it is rightly said:

> लोकस्वरूप विचार कें, आतम रूप निहारि । परमारथ व्यवहार गुणि, मिथ्याभाव निवारि ।।

The real **"saar"** (gist) of the 3 Lok (Universe) is the "Prayojanbhut" and "Saarbhut" tatva i.e. our **Shuddhatma**. Let us seek refuge of our own-selves to do self-realzation and achieve the state of Infinite Bliss i.e Siddha avastha as soon as possible.

Jai Jinendra 🙏
