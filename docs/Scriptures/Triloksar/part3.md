After explaining such great material belongings and happiness of Devlok, Acharyadev in the Gatha 559 and Gatha 560 goes on to explain the real true happiness of Siddha Bhagwaan.

He tells us not to get fooled by this fickle materialistic happiness and explains what the real happiness is like.

In 6 Dhala it is said that:

> " Jo Vimaanvasi hu thay, Samyakdarshan bin dukh paaye"

Which means that without Samyakdarshan (Right belief), even if one has the belongings as a Vimaanvasi dev, then also one is in pain and grief; and real happiness isn't found in materials.
