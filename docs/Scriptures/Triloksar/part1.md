# 0. Introduction

Om Namah Siddhebhya.

Jai Jinendra 🙏

On the occasion of “Shrut Panchami”, won’t it be awesome if we all together go on a “tirth-yatra” across the whole Universe (i.e. 3 Lokas)?

Oh, let me frame it this way - “Won’t it be awesome if we all together do the Swadhay of “Triloksara” granth and know what are the topics covered in it?

“Triloksara” scripture was written by Acharya Nemichandra Siddhant Chakravarti in around 9th Century A.D. This Granth is originally written in Prakrit Language.

The 6 Adhikaars are as follows:

1. Loksamanya-adhikar (Bird-eye view of the Universe + Detailed description of Hell in the Universe)
2. Bhavan-adhikaar (Detailed description of Bhavan-lok heaven in the Universe)
3. Vyantarlok-adhikaar (Detailed description of Vyantar-lok heaven in the Universe)
4. Jyotishlok-adhikaar (Detailed description of Jyotish-lok heaven in the Universe)
5. Vaimanik-adhikaar (Detailed description of Vaimanik-lok heaven in the Universe)
6. Nartiryaglok-adhikaar (Detailed description of Nartiryag-lok (i.e. Human world) in the Universe)

There are 2 main Tikas (commentaries) written on this great scripture.

1. By Acharya Madhavchandratraividhdev (in Sanskrit Language)
2. By Pt. Shri Todarmalji (In Dhundhari dialect)

This scripture has been written by taking references from great scriptures written previously like Tiloypannati etc.
