### Introduction

**"Kshatra Chudamani (क्षत्र चूड़ामणि) - Jeevandhar Swami Charitra"** is one of the greatest Neeti-shastras of Jain Literature available to us today; written by [Acharya Vadibhsinh Suri](/docs/Biographies/Acharya_Vadibhsinh.md).

This scripture portrays the biography of an eminent King - **"Jeevandhar Swami"**, where his various illustrious life events leave imprints for us to learn life lessons, ethics, morals, purity and numerous fundamentals of Jainism.

Acharyadev has beautifully carved this life-story of Jeevandhar Swami to serve us with the remarkable learnings from it in the form of Neetis. Truly, this extraction of learnings from the story is unmatchable and a treasure for us!

Everyone of us must have heard about **Chanakya Neeti**, right? It is a Neeti Shastra (455 Shlokas) that talks mostly about politics and general life-lessons. Well, **Kshatra-Chudamani** (747 Shlokas) is also a **Neeti Shastra**, but it isn't about Politics or other day-today shallow life lessons. Jainism has always been about how to achieve Salvation and become God; and that exact thing is explained in this Shastra. 

**The Question is - Why haven't we read (or even heard) Kshatra Chudamani yet?**

### Who is Jeevandhar Swami?

Jeevandhar Swami was the last (12th) Kamdev of the current [Avasarpini](/docs/Insights/Kaal_Chakra.md) cycle.

Like there are 24 Tirthankars in each Kaal-chakra's half-cycle; similarly along with these there are other great personalities who take birth like Charavartis, Balbhadra, Narayan, Pratinarayan, Kamdev etc.

**Kamdevs**, precisely, are the most personable, attractive and good-looking personalities in the whole Era; and **Jeevandhar Swami* was the 12th of them during the shasan kaal of **24th Tirthankar Bhagwaan Mahavir**.

Jeevandhar Swami attained liberation after renouncing the worldly materialism from Siddhvarkoot Siddhkshetra.

### About the Scripture

This scripture is estimated to have been written in the **10th century**. It has a total of 11 Chapters (Lamb/Adhikaar) written in Sanskrit Language.

It is a work of verse-literature that has **747 Shlokas**; out of which **554 Shlokas** are written to explain Neetis (Moral values), while only **193 Shlokas** describe the life story of Jeevandhar Swami.

This clearly tells us that Acharyadev must have written this scripture to explain **Neetis (morals)**; while the story of Jeevandhar Swami is taken as an illustrious medium for it.

Thus, **Kshatra Chudamani** is a **Neeti-shastra** along with being a **Prathamnuyog** granth.

### What makes this Scripture so special?

**1. Perfect for beginners**
Anyone who has basic knowledge of Hindi language can read and understand this easily. Also, there is no specific prerequisite of knowledge of in-depth Jainism concepts; which makes it just perfect for beginners. Moreover, it has 3 types of explanation for each Shloka:

1. **Anyavarth** - Explains the Shloka translation word-to-word from Sanskrit to Hindi.
2. **Saralarth** - Explains the crux of the Shloka's Anyavarth in even more simpler language.
3. **Vishesharth** - Describes and elaborates the Sararth to lead us towards understanding the clear message and idea of the particular Shloka with an essence of Jainism fundamentals.

**2. Beautiful Storyline**
The life-story would definitely make one dive in the character of Jeevandhar Swami; leading one to revere the greatness of Jeevandhar Swami and fill your heart with **"Vairagya"** at multiple places in the plot - which is truly one of the purest feelings you might experience. Apart from Vairagya - which is the end goal of reading or writing any Jain Scripture; the story also involves a lot of ups and downs, exciting events, suspenseful moments and how Jeevandhar Swami deals with them. 

Because of such a beautiful portrayal, it is almost impossible for our mind waver elsewhere during its Swadhyay and in fact it will make you binge-read this Shastra. 

**3. Real life lessons**
Well, Jainism being the truest **Art of Living**; all the Jain Scriptures teach us how our life should be in different ways. **Kshatra Chudamani** - being a Neeti-shastra has a lot of lessons beautifully derived from life-events of Jeevandhar Swami. 

The Morals taught in the Shastra can be implemented in our day-to-day life and we can relate to these a lot.
