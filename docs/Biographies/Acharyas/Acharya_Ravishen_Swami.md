# Acharya Ravishen Swami

**Acharya Ravishen Swami**; this name is well-known by the whole Digamber Jain community for the composition of his great Jain Scripture **"Padmapuran"**, also known as "Jain Ramayana".

### About

Based on the description of the trees in **43rd Chapter (parv)** of **Padmapuran**, it can be rightly assumed that he was born in the **southern** part of India. 

**Padmapuran** was written in **677 A.D.** (**1207 years** after Bhagwaan Mahaveer and approximately **1343 years** from today), so we can rightly understand that his time was around in **6th and 7th century**.

Unfortunately, there is a very little detail available to us regarding the birthplace, childhood, youth, diksha, works etc. about Acharyadev's life. 

> How great our Digamber Jain saints are! Even after giving so much invaluable treasure of knowledge to us, they have not mentioned anything about themselves!

### Acharya Parampara

In the **Chapter 123, Shlok 167** of Padmapuran, Acharyadev has described his Guru-parampara as below:

"After Tirthankar Mahaveer, there was a great saint who was well-versed with the Aagam's knowledge named **Shri Indra guru**. His disciple (shishya) was **Shri Divakar Yati**; whose disciple was **Shri Arhan Muni**. **Shri Arhan Muni's** disciple was **Shri Lakshmansen**, and **Shri Lakshamsen's** disciple was **Acharya Ravishen Swami**."

Although, there is no definite references available to us today about which 'Sangh'/Gan-Gachak Acharyadev belonged to; but from the suffix **'sen'** after his name, it can be assumed that he belonged to **Sen-sangh**

### Works

**"Padmapuran"** is the first Scripture (Shastra/Granth) ever composed in the Sanskrit Kavya (Poetry) Literature; in which Acharyadev, with **41** different types of Swars (musical notes/tunes) has beautifully narrated the chronicles of Bhagwaan Ramchandra. In the [**Prathmanuyog**](./../../Concepts/Anuyog/Anuyog.md) literature, this was one of the first Jain Scriptures in which such deep description can be seen.

The beautiful story-telling and narration with the help of different types of [Kavya-ras](https://mycoaching.in/ras-aur-bhav) like Shringaar-ras, Karuna-ras etc. Each alphabet, each word of this Shastra resonates **Vairagya** and **Veetragta**.

**Why Prathmanuyog scriptures has Shringaar-ras etc. narrations of materialistic pleasures that leads to Raag (attachment), while our aim is Veetragta?**  

It is a common human tendency to get attracted and connect to stories more. Especially for the souls that are currently blinded into materialistic pleasures and worldly affairs, **Prathmanuyog** scriptures can be a great source for them to bend towards the real path of Salvation.

Because **Prathmanuyog** scriptures have the historical stories of great personalities and their various inspiring life-events, one can relate, learn and take inspirations from it. After all, Jain **Prathmanuyog** scriptures are filled with **Vairagya** and different fundamentals, morals, ethics, lifestyle etc. are served in a form of a story.
:::

**Padmapuran**, also known as **Padmacharitam**, where the real history about Bhagwaan Balbhadra Ramchandra, Bhagwaan Hanumaan, Bhagwaan Sugriv, Sati Sita, Narayan Lakshman and Pratinaaryan Raavan is explained; which ends and refutes all the falsy and imaginary facts existing in the other versions of Ramayana. It is indeed a great blessing to us to have got the right knowledge, resolving all our doubts about the Ramayana.

Although it is known that Acharyadev has taken inspiration from the Prakrit Granth **'Padmachariyam'**, composed by **Shri Vimalsuri**; Padmapuran apparently still is a self-written (maulik) composition of Acharya Ravishen.

There are a total of **123 Chapters (parv)** divided into **6 Parts (khands)** in which different events such as details about past-lives of Bhagwaan Ramchadra, Sati Sita, Lakshman, Raavan etc., birth, kingdom, Sita's Abduction, war between Ram-Lakshman and Raavan, birth of Lav-kush, Sita's Agni-pariksha, diksha by Sitaji, vairagya of Ramchandraji to attaining Moksh from Mangi-Tungi Hills; everything is explained in great depth! This granth is **18,000** shlok-praman!
