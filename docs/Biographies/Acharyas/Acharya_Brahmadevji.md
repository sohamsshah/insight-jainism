   ~ Manglacharan of **Shri Parmatmaprakash Tika**, by **Acharya Brahmadevji** üôèüèª 


**"Acharya Brahmadevji"**, a great name that is revered in the world of spiritual (Adhyatma) literature; was a great Digamber Jain Saint who composed various scriptures in both Nishchay (Absolute aspect representing truth) and Vyavhaar (Relative aspect representing truth) areas; in all 4 [Anuyogas](../../Concepts//Anuyog/Anuyog.md) - clearly depicting the importance to know and follow both. This versatility in knowledge is unparalleled and we are truly indebted to what Acharyadev has given to us.

### About

According to the opinions of various Jain Scholars; because of being adamant in following **"Brahmacharya"** (Celibacy), Acharyadev was entitled with name **"Brahma"**. He was a celibate from childhood and his name was **"Devji"** (Some scholars believe his name was "Brahmadevji" by birth itself). 

Though there is no direct mention of the time in any of his works, but based on various references and scriptures; it is found that Acharyadev purified the land of India at the end of **11th Century A.D**.

### Acharya Paramapara 

* In Bruhad-dravyasangrah, Acharyadev has mentioned **Panchnamaskarmahatma** granth, which is written by Acharya Shri Sinhnandi. So, we can assume that Acharyadev was born after Acharya Shri Sinhnandi.

* Acharya Shubhchandra, in his **Swamikartikeya Anupreksha Tika** has mentioned verses from Bruhad-dravyasangrah numerous times. This tells us Acharyadev's time was before Acharya Shubhchandra.

* From the Bruhadsangrah tika, it is clear that Acharyadev,**Nemichandra Siddhantidev** and **King Bhoj** existed in similar time frame i.e. 11th Century.

### Works

 The Prakrit Tikas (commentary) of **Acharya Kundkund**, which were written by **Acharya Jaysen (7th)** and the Tika on Bruhad-Dravyasangrah scripture composed by **Acharya Brahmadevji** have a lot of similarity in terms of writing style and explanation patterns between each other. 
 
 It might be possible that **Acharya Jaysen** must have got Acharya Brahmadevji's Bruhad-Dravyasangrah Tika. In fact, the language and writing between these two Acharya's is so similar that someone might doubt if both of them are the same person! 

 Today, there are a total of **9 granths (scriptures)** available to us:

 1. Bruhad-dravyasangrah Tika
 2. Tatvadeepak
 3. Gyaandeepak
 4. Trivarnachardeepak
 5. Pratishthatilak
 6. Vivahpatal
 7. Kathakosh
 8. Parmatmaprakash Tika
 9. Kartikeyanupreksha Tika
