### About

The birthplace of Acharyadev is considered to be in the **Dravid (Tamil Nadu) region** of South India in around **10th Century** A.D. 

Most of his life was spent in **Mysore** district. *Pombuchh* region of Mysore was main center of preaching Jainism.

There are 3 names of Acharya available to us today:
1. Odeydev (his birthname)
2. Ajitsen (his Diksha name)
3. Vadibhsinh (his popular/metaphorical name)

The name **'Vadibhsinh'** comprising of 'Vaadi' (Debator) + 'Sinh' (Lion) tells us how great debator has must have been in that time.

Apart from his substantial knowledge of Jain Siddhantas; he was also well-versed with the knowledge of tark (logics/philosophy), vyakaran(grammar), chhand, kavya, alankaar, kosh etc. Also he must be having knowledge of Kannad, Tamil etc. languages including Sanskrit.

### Acharya Parampara

From Acharyadev's **'Gadyachintamani'** granth, it is evident that Acharya Vadibhsinh Suri was a Shishya (student) of **Muni Pushpasen**.

From Shravanbelgola's **Mallishen Prashasti**, reference of the Vidvaan Shishyas: **Shantinath** and **Padmanabh** is found.

### Works

In the **'Mallishen Prashasti'** available in Shravanbelgola; **Ashta-sahastri**’s commentator (tippanikaar) **Acharya Laghusamantbhadra** has mentioned **Acharya Vadibhsinh Suri** in the commmentary's Manglacharan. 

By this, we come to know that Acharya Vadibhsinh Suri was not only a prestigious debater but was also possessing deep knowledge of Jain Siddhants.This fact depicts that he must have written tika on **'Aaptmimaansa'** granth written by **Acharya Samantbhadra**. There is also fair possibility that a Acharyadev might have written more other Maulik Nyaya-granthas which are unavailable to us today. 

There are 2 popular Granths (works) available to us:
1. **Kshatra-Chudamani**
2. **Gadya-chintamani**

Both of these works are based on the life of **Jeevandhar Swami** (who was a one of the 24 Kamdevas of this era and attained Salvation). 

These both literary works are **Kaavya-shastras** written in Sanskrit language.

Kshtatra Chudamani is a **'neeti-granth'** where the life virtues, morals, ethics etc. are explained. In it, the Neetis are explained with the revolving story of Jeevandhar swami and examples from it.

By these works, we can definitely conclude that Acharyadev must have been very much inspired by **Jeevandhar Swami**’s life story and considered him as ideal character.

We are indebted to him for having imparted true knowledge of Jainism to us in the form of his works.
