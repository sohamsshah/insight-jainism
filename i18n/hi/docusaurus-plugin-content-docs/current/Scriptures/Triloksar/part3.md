**After explaining such great material belongings and happiness of Devlok, Acharyadev in the Gatha 559 and Gatha 560 goes on to explain the real true happiness of Siddha Bhagwaan.**

Acharyadev tells us not to get fooled by this fickle materialistic happiness and explains what the real happiness is like.

In 6 Dhala it is said that:

> जो विमानवासी हू थाय, सम्यग्दर्शन बिन दु:ख पाय।

This means that without **Samyakdarshan (Right belief)**, even if one has the belongings as equal to of **Vimaanvasi dev**, then also one is in pain and grief; and real happiness isn't experienced.
