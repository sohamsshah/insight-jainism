# Loksamanya Adhikaar (3 Lokas Overview and Adholoka) [Gatha 1 - Gatha 207]

First of all, Acharyadev does Manglacharan and starts explaining us **“How the Universe works”**.

## Manglacharan

> **Each and every Adhikaar in Triloksar starts with doing Namaskaar (bowing) to all the Akritrim (and Kritrim) Temples which exist in the Universe. This is in itself a beauty of Triloksar, and also explains us the importance of “why we should go to temple everyday”**.

After bowing down to all the Jain Temples in the Universe, there is a genuine question which could be raised in anyone’s mind - “Okay, so you say that all these temples are in the Univers.

**But how do you define “The Universe”?**

## How is this Universe?

There are a lot of misconceptions about the Universe in form of religious beliefs or modern scientific ideologies such as:

- God is the Creator and Controller of the Universe
- The whole Universe is a dream
- Universe of Atoms, Atom inside a Universe
- Big Bang Theory
- Simulation Theory etc.

Well, these theories fail to define the purpose of life, the reason of happenings (life, death, luck etc.). Jainism is different - here everything is purely based on Science, Mathematics, logic and spirituality.

With **6 different adjectives**, Acharyadev explains how the Universe (Lok) truly is in the Verse no. 3 of this Shastra. Read more about this [here](/docs/Insights/How_Is_This_Universe)

The most unique and fascinating thing about Triloksar is the **mathematical and scientific explanations** that are used to define the Universe. Jainism is the only religion in the world which has well defined Mathematical System.

From **Gatha 7 to Gatha 112**, the Jainism mathematics, formualas, calculations, complex theorems etc. are explained! More details will be added soon related to Jainism Mathematics in the blog site!

Having explained Jain Mathematics, Acharya Nemichandra starts to explain the 3 Lokas (Urdhvalok, Madhyalok, Paatallok) and their areas, volume, etc. complex calculations in depth.

In this way, in **Gatha 113 to Gatha 143**, the overview of the whole Universe is portrayed.

Now, we must have got basic understanding of the Universe and its structure, Acharyadev now takes us towards Hell (Narak/Adholok).

> **Whilst all belief system agree to the concept of Hell and Heaven, only in Jainism; you will find the mathematical, scientific and such in-depth explanation of Hell (and Heaven). Well, to know what depth we are talking about, you have to read this great scripture!**

The 7 Hells, their area, the holes (bill) in the Hell and their arrangement, their count and calculation etc. are described here.

Hellish being's (Naraki's) minimum and maximum life-span values, body structure, gender, birth place, how their life is spent, what they eat and the horrifying pain they face in hell is explained in this Adhikaar.

**If this Adhikaar doesn't give you goosebumps and self-realization of imporatnace of human life, then what else will!**

Now, Acharyadev takes us to the Heaven (Urdhvalok)!
