# Introduction

**ॐ नमः सिद्धेभ्यः**

Jai Jinendra 🙏

On the occasion of **“Shrut Panchami”**, won’t it be amazing if we all together go on a “tirth-yatra” across the whole Universe (i.e. 3 Lokas)?

Oh, let me frame it this way - **“Won’t it be amazing if we all together do the Swadhay of “Triloksara” granth and know what are the topics covered in it?**

**“Triloksara”** scripture was written by **Acharya Nemichandra Siddhant Chakravarti** in around 9th Century A.D. This Granth is originally written in Prakrit Language.

There are a total of **1018** Gathas (verses) and the whole Scripture is divided into 6 chapters. The **6 Adhikaars** are as follows:

1. **Loksamanya-adhikar** (Bird-eye view of the Universe + Detailed description of Hell in the Universe)
2. **Bhavan-adhikaar** (Detailed description of Bhavan-lok heaven in the Universe)
3. **Vyantarlok-adhikaar** (Detailed description of Vyantar-lok heaven in the Universe)
4. **Jyotishlok-adhikaar** (Detailed description of Jyotish-lok heaven in the Universe)
5. **Vaimanik-adhikaar** (Detailed description of Vaimanik-lok heaven in the Universe)
6. **Nartiryaglok-adhikaar** (Detailed description of Nartiryag-lok (i.e. Human world) in the Universe)

There are 2 main **Tikas** (commentaries) written on this great scripture.

1. By Acharya Madhavchandratraividhdev (in Sanskrit Language)
2. By Pt. Shri Todarmalji (In Dhundhari dialect)

This scripture has been written by taking references from great scriptures written previously like Tiloypannati etc.
