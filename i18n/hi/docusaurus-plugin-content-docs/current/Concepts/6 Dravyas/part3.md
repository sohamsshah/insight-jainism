# 3. Dharma (Dynamic media) and 4. Adharma (Stationary) Dravya

- The Dharma (Dynamic Medium) and Adharma (Stationary Medium) are the existents of the Universe that are the reason of the "Motion" and "Rest" states existing in the Universe.

- The Dynamic Medium (Dharma Dravya) is the existent which assists the Soul and the Matter to perform ‘motion’. By the virtue of this medium, the motion is possible between matter-matter and Soul-matter and individually of Soul and matter. Similarly the Stationary Medium (Adharma Dravya) assists in 'rest' for the same.

- All the energies, locomotion by legs, movement of car by wheels, external forces etc. are just external indirect reasons for motion and rest. The main underlying reason of that is Dharma and Adharma Dravyas.
