# Time (Kaal)

- One of the most fascinating thing about the definition of "Time" in Jainism is that it is not abstract! Similar to other existents, it is having a physical importance too. Time is classified in 2 different types:

- Relative Time: All the units of time which we deal such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, etc. are relative time. The smallest indivisible unit of "Relative" Time is called Moment("Samay"). One second is made up of infinitely many such "Samay" elements.
- Absolute Time: The ‘Absolute’ time exists as a physicality in the Universe which assists the change in the states of Soul, Matter, etc. As "Atom" is to Matter, the indivisible element of Time element is called Time-element ("Kalanu") which is present on each Space-point of the Universe. More detail in future posts!
