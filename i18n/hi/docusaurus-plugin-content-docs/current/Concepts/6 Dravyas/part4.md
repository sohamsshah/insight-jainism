# Space (Aakash)

- The existent of the Universe which provides a “home” for all the other existents is "Space". The Matter, Soul, dynamic and stationary media and Time; all reside by the virtue of Space (Akash Dravya).

- The existent "Space" is divided into infinitesimal small indivisible elements called "Space-points" (Pradesh). There are multiple definitions to explain the size of a "space-point" on infinite scale in Jainism.

- Moreover, the question of "what is the color of Space or why can't we see it" is illogical. As "color" and "percievability" is the property of matter and not of the other 5 existents!

- Intuitively it is now clear that why one cannot provide physical proofs of Soul, time, space,etc.!
