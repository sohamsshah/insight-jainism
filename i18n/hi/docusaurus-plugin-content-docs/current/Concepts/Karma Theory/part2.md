# 2. The Karmic Cycle

We saw what Karma is and what are its types. But how everything works? What is Karmic Cycle? How to break it? We will talk about all these in this chapter!

## Introduction

The Real essense of Karmic Physics is how these 3 types of Karma are interconnected closely with our lives and all the phenomena around us.

Important to note is that these Karmic Particles are "matter", while we are "Souls".

The Soul has the property of infinite bliss, supreme intelligence, infinite peace, absolute happiness etc. but since these Karmas are bonded, they don't let our Soul's property to fully be experienced.

## The Karmic Cycle

Due to our(soul's) "feelings" of attachment/detachment towards the material surroundings (No-karmas), the Soul attracts the physical "Karmic Particles" (Dravya-karma) to itself.

These Karmic Particles work this way:

- Once they bind to the soul, after a certain amount of time; they come into action and unbind from the soul.

- When they unbind from the soul, they fruit us based on our past deeds and thus we see different consequences around us based on our past karmas.

Now, because of our past Karmas, we encounter different consequences, the soul again does "feelings" of attachment and detachment and binds more new Karmic Particles to it.
And in this way the cycle keeps on repeating!

If we think thoroughly, no phenomenon around us is without a reason. Nothing is random. Everything is BY OUR OWN KARMAS which were BINDED BY OUR OWN FEELINGS, be it Good or Bad and the corresponding consquences are seen.

The important thing to notice here is the "INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONING" of the Universe and Karmic Particles aren't controlled by someone external.

They are just a part of the Universe as other physicalities. "No one is the controller of the Universe, everything phenomenon happens by its own virtue of Happening."

It clearly emphasizes that No one has control over our future. So, in a way; we are the "SCULPTORS" of our own destiny.

We now come to know that because of Karmas, we are suffering in the Universe (Sansar). Absolute Happiness can only be experienced IF one is free from all the Karmas.

And the PATH to become Free from all the bonded Karmas to this Soul is Jainism. And when one is free from all the Karmas, is called GOD.

## Conclusion

Since every living organism is bonded by Karmas, but there is a way to end this Karmic Cycle logically proves that every soul is capable of becoming God.

By our own efforts to seek spirituality and experience the happiness inside ourselves (soul), we can get rid of "Bhaav Karmas", and hence breaking the Karmic Cycle.

But wait, is this it about Karmas? NO. There is detailed explanation about Karmic Bonding, types of Karmas in nature, process of getting free from karmas etc. in Jainism Scriptures; which makes Karma Theory unique and scientific to Jainism.
