# The 4 Karmic States

In the previous chapters we saw what Karma is, how they work and what are their types in considerable detail. This chapter will cover details about the 4 Karmic States and their scientific aspect of Karmic Bonding.

When Karmic Particles bind to our soul, it is called
"Karma Bandh". And this Karmic Bonding can be broadly explained in 4 different States.

But, What are those 4 States?

1. Prakiti: Type of Karmic Particle (out of 8 different types).
2. Pradesh: The number of Karmic Particles bonded in that particular "Karma-bandh".
3. Sthiti: The time after which the Karma will unbind and give its fruit.
4. Anubhaag: The intensity/strength of the results the Karmic Particle produces when it unbinds and fruits.

### 1. Prakriti Bandh

Once Infinite Karmas are binded to our soul, they are not all the same type.

Why? Because the results these Karmas produce are also different when they unbind, then definitely the types of Karmas binded must be different.

In previous post, we can recall the 8 types of Karmas like Gyaanavarn, Darshnavaran etc.

In each samay, this soul binds all these different types of Karmas.

The different type of Karmic Particles bonded is called "Prakriti-bandh".

### 2. Pradesh Bandh

Because of the vibrations happening in the soul some infinitely many karmic particles bond to our soul every "samay" (samay is the smallest unit of time in Jainism physics).

This Vibrations in Soul happen because of movements/changes in mind, speech and body. (this is called 'Yog' [not the Yoga] in Jainism and it is very detailed topic for the scope of this post).

The bonded particles are more and less in number based on the 'Yog' even though being infinite!

The number of "karmic particles" bonded to the soul is called Pradesh-bandh

### 3. Sthiti Bandh

Sthiti Bandh is the time for which the karmic-particle stays bonded with the soul.

For example, if one binds karmic-particles of "sthiti" equal to "10 days", then the result due to the karma will be seen after 10 days i.e. after it "Sthiti" completes.

This state is decided based on the Kashays (feelings of Anger, Ego, Deceit, Greed etc.) done by the Soul.

The Sthiti-bandh in simple words is how much time it would take to Karmas to fruit. One did the deeds in past, when will one get its result?

### 4. Anubhaag Bandh

Anubhaag-bandh state signifies with how much intensity the Karmic Particles will give their result.

If one steals 10 million dollars Vs. other person who stole 10 billion dollars; in the court of law - how the judge will decide punishment?

The person who stole 10 billion dollars will bind Karmas with stronger anubhaag compared to the other. (this is just an example)

Meaning that they will face corresponding bad consequences based on their crimes by the Karmas they binded of corresponding anubhaag bandh! Makes sense, doesn't it?!
