# 1. What is Karma?

In this chapter, we will talk about what exactly is Karma, what is its significance, major types and everything around this topic.

## Introduction

Karma (कर्म) is a physical entity in the universe that governs every phenomena around us.

One is born Rich and other is Poor. Why?
Some are genius, while some are average.
We face hard times and good times. Why?
Why we are humans and that dog is born as a dog?
Why not everytime things happen as we wish even after so much efforts?

Is it all just Luck or randomness? NO.

It is KARMA. The Karmas, done by you in the past.
But, is it just abstract?

## Types of Karmas

Karma is classified into 3 major types:

1. Dravya Karma (KARMIC PARTICLE PHYSICS)
2. Bhaav Karma (FEELINGS/THOUGHTS)
3. No-Karma (YOUR BODY and EVERY PHYSICALITY THAT WE SEE AROUND US)

> **Note**: _Karma Theory is unique to Jainism. "Karma" doesn't mean "work" in this context. Karma has a physical existence. Karma isn't abstract! We all know, everyone on Internet have abused this word a lot, which we all know. Now, it is the time for spreading the right knowledge about it!_

### 1. Dravya Karma

Dravya-Karma are the real matter particles. Like there are atoms of plastic, wood, chemicals; Karmic particles ("Karman Vargana" - one of the 22 subatomic particles defined in Jainism) is also real and existing as a physicality.

But, unlike the other matter particles we are able to around; Karmic Particles CANNOT be seen by eyes or man-made instruments because of their infinitesimal minuteness (10 ^ -inf order size)

Like the matter atoms bind with other atoms, these Karmic-particles can BIND to the Soul also. These are 8 types of Dravya Karmas.

### 2. Bhaav Karma

Bhaav-Karma is the feelings of attachment detachment which are developed by soul on involving its conscience with material objects.

"To feel" and have thoughts is one of the properties of the Soul (any living organism is Soul). Like atoms have properties of mass, physicality, color etc. the Soul has the property to "Feel", "Perceive" etc.

In reality, the soul's characteristic is eternal bliss and happiness. But because of we search happiness in temporary materials, we are never able to get bliss and thus, suffering. If the Soul is free from "Raag-Dwesh" (attachment-detachment), then Bhaav-Karma doesn't happen!

### 3. No Karma

No-karma is whatever we see/perceieve and every physical matter that we are surrounded by. Examples of No-karma are the body, shelter, amenities, mobile phones, food, country, and cumulatively anything from the Universe we come in contact with.

## Conclusion

Adding to this, all of the Karma Philosophy isn't just a THEORY. There is detailed explanation about mathematics and physics about atomic bonding, how it is bind, complex calculation about the formation of karmic-particle molecules (skandh), etc. available in Jainism Scriptures.

In Next Post, we will talk about The Karmic Cycle.
